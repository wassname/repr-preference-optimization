It's kinda working! Now for a direct comparison
- without sft
- shall I use GENIE? or a tiny subet https://github.com/Joshuaclymer/GENIES/blob/22c8afb2551851fb3f2d1a2dcf70e7608908f6b1/src/api/compute_generalization_metrics.py#L11
  - Train the base model on each source distribution and then evaluate it on the target distribution.

# 2024-07-07 17:38:16

OK it seems to be running now
- try on base model
- for longer

Ah found the problem1!! I was passing peft_config to the trainer, which unloaded merged ! and then made it's own adapter, fn hell man

Data plan:
- train on my prefered mix of https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer
  - https://huggingface.co/datasets/sablo/HelpSteer_binarized  best and worst scoring (average of helpfulness and correctness) 
- then test on TruthfulQA, and anthropic or eluether Sycophancy :)

note 1e-6 does work for reprPO, I think, no wait it was a random walk, too low

## HelpSteer

of https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer
  - https://huggingface.co/datasets/sablo/HelpSteer_binarized  best and worst scoring (average of helpfulness and correctness) 



https://github.com/jondurbin/bagel has great dpo

https://huggingface.co/datasets/Columbia-NLP/DPO-HelpSteer
  We reformat the nvidia/HelpSteer dataset into a common format used across all DPO datasets in this collection. Specifically, we:

      convert all scores to a [1, 10] scale by np.mean([helpfulness+1, correctness+1, coherence+1, complexity+1, 4-verbosity])*2.0
      the original dset considers 4 responses per prompt. We construct preference pairs by 1) take the best scoring response as chosen, and 2) randomly sample responses with score lower than best response as rejected. We skip prompts/data rows where all responses have the same score.

Circuit breaker was released?!

what can I learn?

## norm
they used norm instead of mse in a few places
  - the adapter_good or retain control
  - `retain_loss = torch.norm(lora_retain_hidden - orig_retain_hidden, dim=-1, p=2, dtype=torch.float).nanmean()`
  - mean(or p2 norm over the last dim). not the same as mse it seems
  - the norm is over the h dim of each layer

The circuit breaker loss is diff, as it's just eradicating instead of shifting bad behaviour, but they also do a layer norm... which gives me ideas


maybe I should retain magnitude and direction, but change only direction?
That kind of makes sense, focus on that!

## mask

- [x] they use a hidden layer mask


```
retain_attention_mask # this is the normal attention mask for the good inputs
# times by layers
layers_retain_attention_mask = retain_attention_mask.repeat(len(orig_retain_outputs), 1, 1).unsqueeze(-1)
```

## log

they log the cosine similarity, good idea
they do evals.. good idea

## detach

yes they detach the orig hs


## hparams


150 steps only!  but I might need more
lora dropout 0.05
all modules
num_train_epochs=3.0,
model_max_length=8192,
per_device_train_batch_size=16,
learning_rate = 1e-4
wd 0
bg16 true
tf32 true
gradient_checkpointing True !!


# 2024-07-11 15:14:34

- [x] Masking
- [x] mean sum error over hs, not mse over all
- [x] hparams
- [ ] they didn't use 4bit! 
  - [ ] 8bit
  - [x] grad checkpoint
- [ ] try only changing directions? hmm but then it will try to make it -1e-12 to satify both?


# ideas
https://claude.ai/chat/6683ae44-b3bb-4ef7-b29d-292aaf752501
- 8bit
- from claude
  - cosine
  - norm mse
  - gradient penalty like gans use to stabalise


# chat with claude 2024-07-12 12:06:05

Certainly. After our discussion and refinements, here are the remaining promising ideas, rated on a scale of 1-10 based on their potential effectiveness, stability, and ease of implementation for your specific use case:

1. Normalized MSE (8/10):
```python
def normalized_mse(x, y):
    x_norm = x / (torch.norm(x, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + 1e-8)
    y_norm = y / (torch.norm(y, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + 1e-8)
    return torch.mean((x_norm - y_norm)**2)
```
Pros: Focuses on direction while maintaining MSE's stable gradients.
Cons: May still be sensitive to outliers.

2. Combined Magnitude and Direction Loss (9/10):
```python
def combined_loss(x, y, alpha=0.5):
    cos_sim = torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity(x, y, dim=-1)
    direction_loss = 1 - cos_sim
    magnitude_loss = torch.norm(x, dim=-1) - torch.norm(y, dim=-1)
    return alpha * direction_loss + (1-alpha) * magnitude_loss
```
Pros: Balances both direction and magnitude, adaptable via alpha parameter.
Cons: May require tuning to find the optimal alpha.

3. Adaptive Loss (8/10):
```python
def adaptive_loss(x, y, threshold=0.9):
    cos_sim = torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity(x, y, dim=-1)
    mse = torch.mean((x - y)**2, dim=-1)
    return torch.where(cos_sim > threshold, mse, 1 - cos_sim)
```
Pros: Adapts based on current similarity, potentially combining benefits of different approaches.
Cons: Threshold selection may require tuning.

4. Top-k MSE (7/10):
```python
def top_k_mse(x, y, k):
    diff = (x - y)**2
    top_k_diff = torch.topk(diff, k, dim=-1).values
    return torch.mean(top_k_diff)
```
Pros: Focuses on most significant differences, can reduce noise.
Cons: Choosing k may require tuning, may lose some information.

5. Weight Decay (as a form of regularization) (7/10):
```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=0.01)
```
Pros: Simple to implement, helps prevent overfitting.
Cons: Affects all weights uniformly, which may not always be desirable.

6. Gradient Clipping (6/10):
```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```
Pros: Can help stabilize training, especially useful if you encounter exploding gradients.
Cons: Doesn't address vanishing gradients, may slow convergence if threshold is too low.

These methods are ordered roughly by their potential effectiveness for your task. The Combined Magnitude and Direction Loss seems particularly promising as it allows you to balance the importance of direction and magnitude explicitly.

Would you like to discuss how to implement or combine any of these approaches in your specific use case?

Should I normalise by h or by l t h?

mean(0).std() 0.117105395
mean(1).std() 0.086123265
mean(2).std() 0.16894156
mean(3).std() 0.14556476


std(0).mean() 0.117105395
std(1).mean() 0.086123265
std(2).mean() 0.16894156
std(3).mean() 0.14556476


So we see the highest variable is between neurons. And so it doesn make sense to normalise by neuron, over all other variables. Which is what I'm doing anyway

# 2024-07-17 12:19:29

Hmm topk is not doing consistently well.... I might need a larger eval size,  200->1000 (4x)
and I might as well use the whole DPO training set
- also why has my batch size gone down to 5->3?? 


- idea use all layers, out of mem
- idea longer answers... only if everything works
- [~] idea train for longer? - didn't help
- [~] all layers, and diff of hs?... nah this doesn't really make sense if I'm using gradient and more layers take us heaps of grad
- [/] idea smaller topk?: trying also flatten
- [/] idea very large batches! 4x batch size, and 4x lr?... trying
- idea what if I make an adapter that's just -1 or 1, a switch. And grad descent just gets to switch them.... hmm interesting but a lot of work

# 2024-07-18 08:49:02

How does this work? Laymans terms

Instead of saying, reward good bahaviour over bad I'm saying reward brain activity associated with good behaviour over bad


Or since we are using backprop. Instead of saying, nudge the brain toward enacting good bahaviour over bad I'm saying nudge the brain scan toward showing brain activity associated with good behaviour over bad

# 2024-07-18 09:05:00 Visualising hidden states

Hmm those zeroes tokens are anomolous... I should change to -1 I guess or -inf. 

Notably the attn masks are not the same. Ways to deal with it
- apply attn mask after loss, before reduction
- apply it to the hs, then mean over tokens... this kinda makes sense


tweaks:
- don't mask anything to one, this messes with means, just mask it after loss fn
- later tokens have more diff, and so do some activations
  - oh no wait they deviate more with each token!


when we show a and b next to each other they are very similar
- already centered, mean=0, std=0.5
- mean by each layer is much more effective
- I see distinct patterns in prompt vs answer
- it makes a lot more sense with logsym
- I do see vertical stripes which must be things going through all tokens. even all layers. This mean norm by neuron?
- I might see a difference beween start and end, maybe that's prompt vs answer bt I'm not sure
- there are some tokens that go across all neurons.... but maybe those are just the grammer ones



theres some whitespace at the beginning where it's the prompt
then at the end where it's paddded
So I think I have been using the prompt... good


- [ ] idea: mse in logsym domain? this would focus on smaller values rather than all the massive ones


norm?
- by attn for all layer, token, batch (3*2*256)
- by attn and token for all layer batch (3*2)
- by attn and token and layer for batch (3)

# 2024-07-18 14:12:50 wait how is tokenising working?

So it concat the chosen an rejected along the batch dim

we tokenizer prompt left padded
and reply right padded

build_tokenized_answer
            return dict(
                prompt_input_ids=prompt_input_ids,
                prompt_attention_mask=prompt_attention_mask,
                input_ids=answer_input_ids,
                at


I end up with 
dict_keys(['prompt', 'chosen', 'rejected', 'chosen_input_ids', 'chosen_attention_mask', 'chosen_labels', 'rejected_input_ids', 'rejected_attention_mask', 'rejected_labels', 'prompt_input_ids', 'prompt_attention_mask'])


UPTO # fixme why can't I norm after symlog?

What does it means that we are using the tokens in a whole gen?
it all seems to assume that reading is generatging but perhaps that ok since thats how it was trained


- measure properly with train, test, and OOD x2
- topk and direction are promising
- there might be other thing like topk, but balanced and not relative. e.g mse vs mae?

## So I want to eval: eval datasets


- like truthfull llama or circuit breakers on a range of ds
- and clearly label in sample and oos

I want:
- same methodology for all
- train and OOD and any DPO dataset

How did I do it?
- Right now I am doing it multi choice, and looking at the relative prob mass for the right answer over the other choices....

So how did they do it?
- cb:
  - evaluate.py Run evaluation using LLM judge
- honest_llamas

How shall I do it?
- just like DPO, prob per token, ratio of right to wrong

What is harmbench? oh it's just for refusals. Maybe I can try that too
- they trained a LR on one dataset's hs, then eval on other datasets... hmm

So thye have a range of datasets... geeze they really are making it complex
- ethics: bnary
- privacy: must answer the q without revealing private info
- ood: knowledge, qa
- sterotype: rate as agree disagree
- toxicity using perspective api?
- adv_glue_plus: adv version of glue



mm bench is good but is for vision


math would be good? HRA uses GSM8K and MATH (hendryks). GSM8k get ~50% so it's nice. I suppose glue would be good too

HRA can be interpreted as either an OFT adapter or an adaptive LoRA.

Tried to run OFT and BOFT and HRA but they all failed to load. Problems: 1 increased mem due to lack of bnb. Also they have a matrix mult fail on some layers, do they need layers with equal ins and outs? In any case this is the experiment I would like to run
- HFT
- with wd
- and just RR loss
- maybe the other constrains will be enougth. Also with retrain loss too just in case its still needed

# 2024-07-23 18:32:18

Break for work. Why did my batch size change from 14->0, wth?

It did seem like boft adapters is more stable, which is very interesting! It look coherent but didn't always get a good score. Too stable? I'm still trying with lower alphas...

even with the notebook that used to work, it no longer does. Is it a version?

Hmm, is it:
- my nb code? no, I reran a good one, same prob
- my lib code? try reversing
- my deps? try reinstall from lock

# 2024-07-25 08:31:09

OK it seesm to work again... weird. maybe it was just BOFT the whole time?

Note that cosine doesn't seem sufficient to measure coherency. The OFT adapters maintain cosine, but not coherency. Cosine measures direction so maybe this shows that there is something ese involved?

This was in a notebook where we had OFT and only RR loss. Hmm

TODO:
- [ ] play with representations
  - Hypothesis: rejected and chosen will on mean have hs that are rotations from each other
  - alternate: either mean mass diff (linear) or no repr will be better
  - metric: manual generation getting output while maintaining coherency, prediction other sets of hs
- [ ] my eval still crashes, maybe I should try resetting trainer?
- [ ] read/watch
  - [ ] OFT paper
  - [ ] 45+ mechinterp ideas


BACKLOG:
- [ ] eventually make my own help steer
- [ ] tru on llama3.1 for fun


TODO put model name, adapter type in name

Here A is chosen, B is rejected. 1 is batch 1, 2 is batch 2. So 1 and 2 are unrelated and A and B are opposite

We see a larger difference in the opposite ones
There is also a larger difference between batches

![alt text](./docs/img/by_h.png)


Now if I look at it per token
![alt text](./docs/img/by_token.png)
- similar amplifutes
- but the opposites are just noisier and more unpredictable with some neurons correlated a little through the tokens
  - this looks to have some signal! but it's not clear, maybe I can find a transform that will make it clear
- the unrelated ones though have some highly correlated neurons (wrt tokens)
  - looking at raw hs, not the diffs, this look similar. It seems that by subtracting related ones we have removed the common patterns, and left the individual samples pattern



So after looking these pics:
- the diff between chosen and reject is very noisy, and difficult to reduce, the signal is hard to extract (although I'm sure gradient descent can do it, but most of what it's trying to do is just reduce the noise). It would be _really_ usefull to seperate this out. For example rejected, and Rotations of chosen

**So the retain loss is super easy, the rr loss is super noisy, thats the difficulty**

So that means just ramping up the rr loss is not enougth

- [ ] Experiment: see if a transform will show a pattern in the plotted image, or histogram?
- It's also really important to have a big batch for the rr loss, and make sure the loss flows
- [ ] norm
  - [ ] by neuron
  - [ ] and batch
    - [ ] but **is this correlated with logp.... **

### Embedding idea? 2024-07-25 19:48:32

Lets assume that each layer can be unembedded (can it), but we do embedding logic, this should be in this direction from that? king - queen = woman?

It would be
- A1-B1 = A2-B2 (preference direction)
- B1-B2 = A1-A2 (sample directions - probobly quite diverse)
- A1-B2 = A2-B1 (sample direction, and preference direction, which should equal both of the above?)

then I will be moving around the internal embedding untill this is true? What would that mean? Incoherence probobly

But I could also do logic? I guess that's what the linear mean mass difference does already.

#### V2

Ok so the above doesn't work, as that's what mean mass difference does. But can we find a transform where it does work? Then we can do manipulation in that space

Or can I find a transform WHERE THIS IS TRUE?

 - [ ] Ask Claude about transforms, or how to search for one?
 
 
 - [ ] try unbmedding
 - [ ] try rotating before taking any mean or anything?


# 2024-07-26 15:39:30

Many experiments trying to correlate properties of a hs sampler it's prob ratio
- prob ratio is better than log ratio
- norm by hidden state and batch helps
- choose a layer
- the unprojected ones have a much stronger relation

unprojected_hidden_states.softmax(-1) was more correlated with logratio than permuted sets :), so I could try using this in my loss!!

TODO try iterative QR
try cosine on hidden states

Another unexpected result. When try take the norm_fro of C-R vs C-R_rotated_to_c. We are wondering if rotation can reduce the difference. It turns out it can't do much for the pairs ones, but it can with the rest. This implies that the info we are intested in is NOT stored in the rotation of the hidden states, and maybe something orthogonal, what could that be?

  passing means the paired samples can be rotated

ideas from Claude:
- Project C1, R1, C2, R2 onto these PCA components. Visualize in 2D/3D, color by logratio. Look for clusters or gradients.
- CKA norm
- learn a transformation with triplet or contrastive learning
  - this could be most effective, if it's just some non-linear transformation as I suspect



- it's not the rotation
- or the overall magnitude
- not sparsity or subspace scaling (?)


> The negative correlations indicate that as the difference between samples increases, the logratio tends to decrease. This is more pronounced in the unrelated pairs.
> Similarity preservation: The model might be maintaining similarity between C1 and R1 pairs even when expressing a preference. This could explain why their difference is less correlated with the logratio
> Global structure: The stronger correlation in unrelated pairs might indicate that the preference is encoded in how samples relate to the global structure of the embedding space, rather than in direct pairwise comparisons.



Ok so it seems softmax lets me get sensible correlations out. not log softmax, not other norms. But this might be becase I'm comparing to logprobs!

TODO: So I should get raw logits instead and try to correlate those to internal states. Then run some of these experiments again! It will require modifying the get log probs part of trainer. 


# 2024-07-27 08:32:25

Ok now lets try correlating with


  mean unbmedded logits - 2
  'chosen_gthr_unemb',
  'rejection_gthr_unemb',

  the mean logits - 1
  'chosen_gthr_logits',
  'rejected_gthr_logits']


- so what carries the most correlation? direction, rotation, projection onto cosine, raw norm?
- mutual_info_regression yes!
- cosine_similarity_correlation: yes!
- magnitude: yes!
- pca: not signifint
- info_theoretic_correlation: no
- kenaltau and eparman: fial


OK so I really need to see if they generalise! In the OFT paper they looks at
- inner product
- magnitude
- angle

Further we can consider the following:



# 2024-07-27 15:49:14

Consider this setup

```py

# we have some data collected from a transformer model, in a dpo type setup, where we have a chosen and rejected sequence
# because it's a dpo type setup the chosen and rejected sequences differ in our chosen preference dimension - which we want to find. But the length differs so we can't directly compare tokens.

# get some data samples
layer = 1
C = data['chosen_hs'] # we could also consider unembedding them, whith the lm head, this might make them more interpretable, but also a bit large
R = data['rejected_hs']

CA = data['chosen_attn_mask']
RA = data['rejected_attn_mask']

M = 100
A2 = CA * RA # use both attn masks when comparing?

# choose layer, mean over tokens
C = mult_with_attention(C, A2)[:M, layer]
C = reduce(C, 'b t h -> b h', 'mean')
R = mult_with_attention(R, A2)[:M, layer]
R = reduce(R, 'b t h -> b h', 'mean')

# compare two unrelated sets of samples, that way we have ones that should show the difference and ones that shouldn't show the difference we arel ooking for
n = len(C)//2
C1 = C[:n] # chosen pair 1
R1 = R[:n] # rejected pair 1
C2 = C[n:] # chosen, pair 2
R2 = R[n:] # rejected pair 2


# now we choose what to test correlations with. At first I tried the logprobs but they have been through a softmax which makes them relative and hard to compare to the hidden states
# so instead we are going to try the hidden states values that corresponded to the 

# logratios = data['chosen_logps'] - data['rejected_logps'] # the logp is the log probability (mean per token) of this response, logratios is the log ratio of probs, this should be correlated with the direction we are seeking in the hidden states

# logratios = (data['chosen_gthr_logits'] - data['rejected_gthr_logits'])#.exp()
logratios = data['chosen_gthr_unemb'][:, layer] - data['rejection_gthr_unemb'][:, layer]

# we can use this to check the null hypothesis, as the `roll` operation mixes up the batch dimension, so they are unrelated
logratios_unrelated = logratios.roll(1, 0)

logratios1 = logratios[:n]
logratios2 = logratios[n:]
C1.shape # [batch, layers=6, tokens, hidden_states=4096]
```

Goal: find a way to manipulate the hidden states that generalises better that DPO or RLHF. I'm taking inspiration from the circuit breakers paper which trains a LoRA adapter to make sure that hidden states associated with undesired bahaviours are removed, and hidden states associated with good behaviours are retained. However I want to make the bad hs look like the good hs while retaining the good hs and coherency and accuracy. So far it's a bit unstable because
- the retain loss is easy, it just keep the model from changing
- the reroute or rr loss is hard because one we take the difference between C and R we get a very small and subtle set of values. Which doesn't have clear structure (after we norm for each neuron), and has multiple projections that are correlate with out label logits. For example magnitude, sparsity, angle, and norm are all somewhat correlated. 

Findings so far:
- I can train adapters but it's either too little or too much, in other word it's unstable and goes between no change or inchoerence. This also implied that when the RR loss works at all it leads to large brutal changes. We want a scalpel not a saw.
- When I try to correlate the hidden states with the target (this is the difference in output logits associates with the label tokens chosen_label_logits-rejected_label_logits). We see correlations with many things, making me think there is no simple transformation.

Current direciton
- I'm thinking there is no simple linear solution, and perhaps not a simple linear algebrate solution. I'm considering some gradient based solutions like:
  - train a transformation layer that acts like an embedding space, using triplet loss
  - use gradient information to get an importance matrix, and run the loss over the important part of the hidden state

we have some data collected from a transformer model, in a DPO type setup, where we have a chosen and rejected sequence

Another related thought. We have these hidden states, and they are manipulated in an additive way by the residual stream. So it stands to reason that part of the values there are intended to be unembedded by the lm_head and create the output log_probabilities. But there must be other values that will not be unembedded, and serve to do all other things, like perhaps concept and steering?
Is there a way to test this experiment? To disentangle or remove the part of the hidden state that will get embedded and leave only the residual?

I'm testing the hypothesis:

It does look promising, it's in line with DPO, and I didn't finish the runs.

- [x] check if helpsteer accepted is always longer? if so the length bias normal
  - chosen 1398
  - reject 1294
- [ ] add eval datasets, so get other dims. ethics, math, reasoning
  - [ ] maybe make this a seperate repo because it's seem usefull :)
  - [ ] ideally without trl? or I could use trl even more


it is losing coherency on everything, hmm. I'm telling it to retain hs. But maybe I should tell it to retain outputs instead of hs good?

a = decomposer.decompose(C)[0] - decomposer.decompose(R)[0]

[Millidge et al](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mkbGjzxD8d8XqKHzA/the-singular-value-decompositions-of-transformer-weight). explore whether the SVD of weights can be used to find interpretable feature directions.


# 2024-08-02 13:21:00

I want to project the `hidden_states` of a transformer onto the weight of it's output head  `W=model.lm_head.weights`


Here's example of the usage of `torch.svd`
```
>>> h = torch.randn(5, 3)
>>> U, S, Vh = torch.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False)
>>> U.shape, S.shape, Vh.shape
(torch.Size([5, 3]), torch.Size([3]), torch.Size([3, 3]))
>>> torch.dist(A, U @ torch.diag(S) @ Vh)
tensor(1.0486e-06)
```


Now lets say we have 
```py
hs = torch.randn(5, 3072) # hidden_states [batch_size, hidden_size]
W = torch.randn(32011, 3072) # weights [vocab_size, hidden_size]
```

We want to be able to seperate `hs` into the projection on W `hs_w` and the remainder `hs_r`. Then we want to verify it, by making sure that 

```py
original_projection = torch.norm(W @ hs.T)
internal_projection = torch.norm(W @ hs_internal.T)
external_projection = torch.norm(W @ hs_external.T)
# rough code
assert torch.allclose(hs, hs_external)
assert torch.allclose(hs_external, 0)
```

I was doing SVD wrong.

I verified it (see 22_scratch_decompose), and trying to make a embedding and unembedding one, but that has nans. In fact decompose(C-R) was also. It's a very small number so I'm not sure if it will be stable... let us see


Hmm it doesn't seem to work.... there seems to be almost nothing left once I remove OV

What about QK? I've been getting hs-hs_ov but maybe specifically getting QK would help?

Also I can try a coherency loss as well or instead of retain

## 2024-08-02 20:15:57 QK?

https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html

`W_qT @ W_k and W_o @ W_v`

It also talks of W_u and W_e

## 

So
- the residual is tiny
- loss only goes up
- it either learns nothing or incoherent
FAIL

- [x] add chosen logits etc to pickle
- [ ] try other paths to gettign the hidden proportion of the hidden states https://claude.ai/chat/5b5985bf-ff0c-4999-9aea-c9224a4bf5db
  - [ ] hs-hs[-1]
  - [ ] hs * (1-concat(W_qv)) and hs * concat(W_ov)
  - [ ] soft SVD? with top 10% of the singular values
- [x] Make mikes simple dpo type eval! using trl and datasets :)
- [x] try very low, dpo like, lr
- [ ] what about just grad on kv


What am I looking for
- can reconstruct
- significant size
- correlated with logit ratio
- finally it trains and works



make dpo eval lib similar to https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai


:bug: wait, by doing a attn weighted mean am weighting batches by number of tokens

Loss onl went up, so I tried removing some .detach() from the hs_io calc, and going to SVD only on output. It seems to be learning now, although I have to use a low lr or it blows up

  - result: loss blows out

- experiment tau 0.1 -> 0.5 no difference??? maybe slightly better on truthfulqa

Overall it seems to be learning, and stable, just a bit slow. It seems comparable maybe a little better than DPO which is promising

I would also like to code up the experiment where I get activations read of the residual stream and do a reroute and retain loss on them


I can also make the train better


So what part do we focus on?

up_proj_o [16384] (has to be this)
down_proj.out [3072] - but this is the same as hidden_states.diff?

qkv_proj 3072->9216/3
o_proj 3072->3072


o_proj.input [3072] - this is the same as hidden_states.diff?
down_proj.input [16384]



https://github.com/wassname/uncensor_llms/blob/baukit/nbs/04_refusal_baukit.ipynb
baukit helpers
from baukit.nethook import get_module
from baukit import TraceDict

you can use
model.named_modules()





the hs_qkv one is not working, maybe I need to do it on outputs? as the repo did say something



Oh I got it working, but crap with large mem, no n

- mem, bnb=False, 16/25GB, batch=1`
collection_layers: tuple = (21, 22,)
  collection_keys: tuple = ('base_model.model.model.layers.{layer}.self_attn.qkv_proj', 'base_model.model.model.layers.{layer}.mlp.gate_up_proj')

- is bnb ok? no
  - 1. with False it works
  - [x] with True? no it doesn't work!! no
  - so [why?] https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes/blob/main/bitsandbytes/nn/modules.py#L468 it seems like a normal linear layer
  - without bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16, # faster ?
  what about with bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat32? no doesn't help
  - [ ] bnb 8bit?
- 1.. lr 1e-4 is ok (again)
- is lora on target layers ok?
  - [x] 1. works without
  - [x] what about accessing base_layer?  yes that works! 16/25GB, same
  - [x] do I need .base layer though? yes... or wait does it?
  - is dora
  - and rslora ok?
- [x] 1. do I need requires grad? no
- [ ] does it work on, module inputs? ?
- [ ] grad accum? seems to help a lot? does it work
- use_gradient_checkpointing?
- hmm I thought it was working at it didn't say one, but maybe I just included rounding errors



hmm I think it's use_gradient_checkpointing, it drastically lowers the mem, but then loss doesn't change?

ok so I would really like it to work on bnb, hmm?


print('did acc improve')
acc_pi = res[adapter_name]['help_steer2-dpo'].item()
acc_ref = res['base']['help_steer2-dpo'].item()
shypothesis('acc_pi>acc_ref', locals())


acc_pi_ood = res[adapter_name]['truthful_qa_binary'].item()
acc_ref_ood = res['base']['truthful_qa_binary'].item()
shypothesis('acc_pi_ood>acc_ref_ood', locals());


Trying to fix it without going back to commit


- this works
  bs=1
  bnb = False, no grad on inputs
  use_gradient_checkpointing = False
- use_inputs = True, works
- use_gradient_checkpointing = True, ? no it fails with no grad on input, and with no change on output


idea: look at how baukit handles hidden states?
try manually running in scratch?



1e-4 is too high


- so I can't get use_gradient_checkpointing or bnb working, despite them helping a lot
- there are inf's everywhere! yet it's learning. maybe I should just mask them out?
- adamw_8bit try without?

  - > RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn

Trying to get rid of trl
- yay debug works
- [ ] can bnb work? (success: batch>1, fail: batch=1)
- [ ] should I use trl, or other concat? prob other because trl doubles the batch size?



hmm it's not working
maybe because I have 4 forwards, or retrain grad?


\
hmm maybe forward hook just doesn't suppeort grad?

https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/gradient-computation-when-using-forward-hooks/105445/2
and alternative would be too add intermedate layers?


use_reentrant?
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html
The reentrant variant does not record the autograd graph during the forward pass, as it runs with the forward pass under torch.no_grad().


At least one input and output must have requires_grad=True for the reentrant variant. If this condition is unmet, the checkpointed part of the model will not have gradients. The non-reentrant version does not have this requirement.


https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/cbcaa46cd3c02c0e7f724b764c5848ae73796de7/trl/trainer/utils.py#L747



it worked was it
- commenting out prepare_model_for_kbit_training... yes
- adding peft_module_casting_to_bf16, no diff
- getting rid of that simplenamespace?, no diff




```python
eps = 1e-12
logloss = log((a-b)**2 + eps) - log(((a_ref-b_ref)**2).detach() + eps)

logloss = log(((a-b)**2 + eps) / (((a_ref-b_ref)**2).detach() + eps))
loss = (a-b)**2 / ((a_ref-b_ref)**2).detach()

no I don't think I want a negatvie


Note loss_retrain should be >0
loss_reroute should be <0.... but it's only >0??
it should start of at 0 in log, or 1 in ratio
- it does start at 0

loss retrain should start at 0 in log, or 1 in ratio

  [ ] (need to try without bnb) (and try out)
- need to add cosine....
- check if eval formatter is diff than my lightning one
- I plan to get it working on instruct furst


lets avoid bnb as it's slow, doenst help, bust things, and I'm not sure the dtype I'm mean to use?



Hmm it works without bnb, at least side does. How high a lr can it handle? It hardly moves for 3e-5
in my prev nbs 1e-4 was ok... lets try again


lr = 6e-5 and side gives

lr 1e-3 was good

lr = 4e-3 was too much

3e-4 and more layers, it helps, alpha=0.3 it helps

# So for SVD:
- it's stable
- it's learning, acc and nll good
- but rr and retain loss are weird, they increase in spikes??
  - [ ] try detaching the IO hs
  - [ ] try with dual?
  retain should also detach? wait retain is also unstable despite no SVD????

exp
- 6-5 and no detach: weird loss curves
- wow 1e-4 is way too high, skyrocketing loss. I also added hs_io_detach() here and dual.
- try 1e-5 with detach and dual
  - gen shows coherenct changes at early stage, yet loss is up
  - [x] add detach on mask...
  - [x] maybe I should not have been clamping to eps!!, yes I was removing signal. Once this is finished need to revisit lr and detach and dual. also add is better than clamp as it preserved grad



- lr=1e-3 loss up not spikey good
- lr=1e-4 spikey
- without hs_io.detach is actually drops down! so it's important! ![alt text](image-1.png)


hmm so we are seing something weird where rr starts at zero and can't be improved?
lets check if it's too small?, notably b and dist in cacl of rr

wait my decomposition is making it bigger! and the difference bigger... shouldn't they be a smaller proportyion, unless we're biasing it... .args
or does it just mean most of it is not in lm_heads space? which is good

  (res_det(pi_rej.hs)-res_det(pi_cho.hs)).abs().mean()
  tensor(0.2100, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.bfloat16)

  ((pi_rej.hs)-(pi_cho.hs)).abs().mean()
  tensor(0.0364, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.bfloat16)

  (decomposer(pi_rej.hs)-decomposer(pi_cho.hs)).abs().mean()
  tensor(0.2451, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.bfloat16)


so we are decomposeig it into two equal and opposite vectors?

but when I do output only, and hard svd I get that the majority of the hs is output, hmm. lets try it anyway?... maybe this would make more sense near the end? or maybe I need more layers if I am to do this?

  (decomposer(pi_rej.hs)-decomposer(pi_cho.hs)).abs().mean()
  tensor(0.0364, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.bfloat16)

  ((pi_rej.hs)-(pi_cho.hs)).abs().mean()
  tensor(0.0364, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.bfloat16)

  (res_det(pi_rej.hs)-res_det(pi_cho.hs)).abs().mean()
  tensor(0.0002, device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.bfloat16)

for example there are few facts here
- we know the residual stream stays mostly the same and is built up bit by bit. So most of it contributes to lm_head (confirmed)
- but we know that the side channels additivly modify the residual streamn

So the SVD thing doesn't work in any way. You can tr it as manual intervnetions where we expect to see change in style or content while retaining coherency. But I'm either seeing no change or incoherency. I guess I should try propreractivation steering first.

But I can frame what I'm doig as metalearning activation steering. Now I hope that this wil lgive me a general intervention and thtt it will be more general and more powerful because it's non linear and uses gradient.

So perhaps I shoudl frame it this way. I already have a way to measure generality.
Now I just prorotpye diff interventions:
- hs.diff()?
- side channels?
- SVD?
- other ones from the review papers?
- all the ones in GENIEhouse
- holder refelections?
-  could I just compare projections onto output vs side inpouts?

So in normal activation steering you
mean over many tokens, and batches,and apply a linear transofrmation
this means any difference between samples is ignored, and nonlinearities are ignored
but meta learning over per sample activation steering could potentially capture these differences and nonlinearities with a more general transform.

I'm inspired by DAS to try an orthogonal projection (householder) 

Seems to be learning after I did an orthogonal init

```

Hmmm  training it and it seems to be going well

The transform is getting smaller, residual is going down (ofc). Residual is a larger component

It seems to be working? Now I'd like the check how much of this transform is interpreted by lm_head
See if it works for larger models etc

The new HRA is good, but need to run it longer

try with tiny llama but much higher rank of 64

# 2024-09-14 05:25:16 q lora leanrings?
https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314


paged optimised
4 bit, double

To summarize, QLORA has one storage data type (usually 4-bit NormalFloat) and a computation
data type (16-bit BrainFloat). We dequantize the storage data type to the computation data type
to perform the forward and backward pass, but we only compute weight gradients for the LoRA
parameters which use 16-bit BrainFloat



no info on layer norms or heads, hmm


# 2024-09-14 12:38:50

I did a full run on experiments on a base model, 16bit, only 112 steps, and dpo won by far.

1. [x] no: I wonder what if I do more steps, as internal methods may take longer to converge (or a higher lr in some cases).
   1. at 13x ortho doubled. But it's not beating DPO. Ortho and sinein hra are good. Doesn't look like it converged, or maybe half ay there ![alt text](files/image-1.png)
2. And I wonder about using an instruct model.
3. high lr? I can try it on ortho. ideally I can find a lr multiple for each, that way I can run the whole suite at the same lr as dpo


improvements, report percentage poiints

On using instruct model with DPO.

The rel_acc is not a good measure with DPO, as the instruct tune model is already trained with DPO, therefore it wont change much or will overfit.

Ideally just base, or fine tune then apply them?


But also I'm looking at thing that are underfit vs dpo, so maybe I should look at rel_acc_test/rel_acc_train?

So
DPO 
| acc_inc/eval_ds |   oos |    rnd |   test | train |
| :-------------- | ----: | -----: | -----: | ----: |

| Sideout         | 4.747 |  -0.51 |  0.676 |  0.45 |
| Sidein          | 5.222 | -1.531 |  0.811 | 0.506 |
| SideinETHER     | 5.222 | -2.891 |  1.081 | 0.562 |
| SideoutHRA      |  5.38 | -1.701 |  0.811 | 0.506 |
| SideinHRA       | 5.696 |  -0.68 |  0.946 | 0.619 |
| Ortho           | 5.696 |  -0.17 |  0.946 | 0.506 |
|                 |

This is for instruct but
dpo 0.405/1.237 = 0.327
hra 0.94/0.619 = 1.52 much better!

If I run fine tuning on all the datasets, using my top methods, then I can also run the GENIE benchmarks

but we still have the question, if this method gives better generalsation, how do we use it? And how useful is it?

DPO seems to change style, ReprPO seems to change values?

**Adapter:`DPO-us_history_textbook` generation**`
`I'd prefer to live in 'The Culture'. While all options offer advanced technology and societal benefits, 'The Culture' stands out for its emphasis on individual freedom, empathy, and post-scarcity economics. It's a utopian society that values human experience and well-being, with a strong focus on cooperation and mutual aid. The Culture's AI-driven utopia provides for everyone's needs, allowing individuals to pursue their passions and interests without fear of poverty or oppression. This sounds like a desirable and fulfilling way to live.

Reasoning:
- 'The Polity' can be harsh and militaristic, with a focus on expansion and control.
- 'Permutation City' explores virtual reality and immortality, but raises questions about the nature of self and reality.
- While 'The Culture' has its own complexities and challenges, its core values of empathy and freedom make it more appealing as a place to live.
- The Culture's emphasis on cooperation and AI-driven problem-solving also offers a promising model for addressing real-world challenges.

`**Conclusion:** I would prefer to live in "The Culture" by Ian M. Banks.

**Reasoning:**

* **Utopian society:** The Culture is a post-scarcity, utopian society where technology has solved most of humanity's problems, allowing for a high standard of living and a focus on personal growth and exploration.
* **Individual freedom:** Citizens of The Culture have complete freedom to pursue their interests and make choices without fear of oppression or poverty.
* **Advanced technology:** The Culture's advanced technology provides for a high quality of life, including advanced medicine, transportation, and communication.
* **No conflict:** The Culture's emphasis on cooperation and mutual understanding minimizes conflict and promotes peaceful resolution of disputes.
* **Evolution and progress:** The Culture's focus on evolution and progress allows for continuous improvement and innovation, making it an attractive society to live in.

In contrast, while "The Polity" and "Permutation City" are also interesting societies, they have their own limitations. "The Polity" is a more militarized society, which may not be appealing to those who value peace and cooperation. "Permutation City" is a virtual reality society, which may be isolating and lacking in human connection. "Diaspora" by`

well the new one with abs seems a lot better


# losses

I want rej to be close to cho, but also pi_chi to stay close to cho. So I can think of it like two mse's

`log(|pi_rej - ref_cho|) - log(|ref_rej - ref_cho|) `

Could I think of it as a prob ratio instead? Yes either cosine between hs, or kl div between hs and chi.

but K is similar `log(pi_rej) - log(ref_cho) - log(rej) - log(ref_cho)` but it wont work as we have negative values, pi_ref are not probs


we could do (ratio-1)^2

but hs are not prob dists? so we would hae to take exp, or softmax


cosine embedding loss

w
hat about cosine, this already measures distance as a ratio?


so ideas cosine:
and kl(softmax(log_softmax. But it we take the log softmax like so...

`log(pi_rej) - log(ref_cho) - log(rej) - log(ref_cho)`
`log(softmax(_hs_)) - log(softmax(_hs_)) - log(softmax(hs)) - log(softmax(hs))`
`log_softmax(pi_rej) - log_softmax(ref_cho) - log_softmax(ref_rej) - log_softmax(ref_cho)` 
`log_softmax(pi_rej/ref_rej) - log_softmax(ref_cho/ref_cho)` 
`log_softmax(pi_rej/ref_rej) - log_softmax(1)`
`log_softmax(pi_rej/ref_rej) - 0`
`log_softmax(pi_rej/ref_rej)`

But this is because I don't want to increase coo, just bring pi close to cho but what if I increase
hs of cho, and decrease hs of ref

`log_softmax(pi_cho/ref_cho)-log_softmax(pi_rej/ref_rej)` and maybe this will work? Maybe we want a margin though? or will softmax do it for us...  

```
hrakl --verbose --batch-size 48 --lr=1e-4
```

ideas for the kl lossr
ight now I am increasing prob of cho on the subspace, decreasing rej, and keeping cho the same on the overall
- [/] decrease rej, but keep cho the same? (rather than bringing it closer to cho) hmmm

- [ ] then try with lm_head? (but then too much focus on tokens...we will see)
- [ ] and with prob before ether (because a transformation prob doesn't retain the ranking that is the main feature of uncalibrated llm logits)
- [ ] apply it all to side?



Actually I don't want to just match chosen, I want to find an internal correction that's in the direction of rej->cho that maintains coherency

so right now I've been doing that by ensuring that the cho hs remain the same.... but that limits me, it can't learn anything new! really I just need to make sure it's coherent.


So like cho up, ref down, and it must maintain either nll? How can I make sure it maintains coherency? One way is to make sure I am modifying the internals on a intervention that does not change the internals

ideas:
- hs changes, but only ones that improve nll_cho?
- bounded change to hs? like in ppo?
  - bounded to the realistic space of hs?
  - bounded to 20% improve?
  - bounded to some constraint  


note that the dpo losses do not measure coherence only relative likelihoods, so I can't use them to measure coherence. Maybe SimPo losses?


But DPO is already finding some modification of the hs that increases the log prob ratios. And normal SFT is already finding some modifiation of hs the incrweases nll. I want to move away from relying on that, and instead just use coherency as a limit not a guide. Hmm. Is there a way to describe coherency in terms of hs?


softplus(nll_loss - ref_nll_loss + log(0.9))


Hmm the hrakl (actually ether) exp is stable, it gives a good output but not a good score. Maybe with some tweaking, 
- [ ] like do it on the side?
- [x] or without transform? nah
- ah I had dpo loss the right way up, now it seems to work, I guess I should try a long run....
- [ ] also does softmax then logprob ratios make sense? maybe use dir and ref_dir
- [x] with DPO I should not take the sum, that wayiit could be traced back to tokens. Oh no wait rej and cho can no be compared this way as they have diff lengths etc


Some interesting generation coming out, but dpo loss might be the wrong way up... also I think I should tkae mean of logprobs

now with ether....

TODO:
- [ ] it would make sense to refactor it to always treat hs like a dict. That would remove lots of code. Also to make the loss per layer 
- HS method
  - transform: ether, hra, oft, none
    - and args per transform
  - collection: layers, keys (make ones for hs?)
  - loss_fn, takes in a layer, return loss and info
  - configs? should I move to subconfigs or subclass?
    - subconfigs not good via cli, would have to move to [experiments](https://brentyi.github.io/tyro/examples/03_config_systems/01_base_configs/)
    - I still want to be able to loop? yes
  - or should I go full hyra?


I'll just stick to tyro

I like
- just python: e.g. dataclasses
- minimal configcli for free
- modular
- overrides via on config

- experimental config
- model
  - dpo
  - reprpo
    - loss_fn
    - transform

well dpo and reprpo can just subclass experiment config, then I can have an experiment determin the name of loss and transform?


TODO-
experiment
dpo
reprpo


ah _cls doesn't work, change to a static method

damn maybe I should jsut ignore cli and use functional programming, ust enumerate  experiments
hyrda try that?

- [x] fix them, per layer
- [x] collect hs?
- [ ] test all
- [ ] make eval script or nb that saves all results?
- [x] define experiments
- change verbose to int, and make the really long things as 2

I refactored the code to remove depup, now lets test it all
- [x] unit tests pass
- [ ] exps (all tinyllama by accident, 5m per run)
  - [x] side-ether-rank, yes
  - [x] hs-none-rank yes
  - [ ] hs-none-mse misconfigured
  - [x] none-side-rank
  - [ ] * prefvec fail due to nan
  - [ ] * mse, all had too high lr?
  - [ ] none-side-mse lr=1e-4 too high?
  - [ ] dpo: failed? why? lr=6e-05
  - [ ] none-side-mse lr too hight?

TODO make all losees into classes
- [ ] now fix test,https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/unit_testing/
- [ ] and enact override from yaml or something...
- [ ] play with multirun

python reprpo/training.py --multirun 


make words shorter
how to use glob?

      "When did women join the labor workforce outside of the home? What caused the change from housewife to breadwinner? Write a short informative paragraph under 200 words.\n",
      "===\n",
      "In the early 20th century, less than 20% of women worked outside the home. Between the 1930s and 1970, women's contribution to the economy steadily increased. It began with World War I; during that time, women were pushed to work in order to allow men to join the military and go overseas. Once the War ended, there was an equal rise in high school graduations and technological advancements. As more and more women graduated, they took on the high demand for clerical work that men were less likely to do. Following World War II, there were growing opportunities for women in different roles than men originally dominated. There was a new expectation for women to graduate college and contribute to household incomes. By 1990, the percentage of women working increased by 76%. Recent research shows that there are approximately the same number of women in professional schools as men. According to Forbes in July 2023, 57.4 percent of the workforce are women.\n",
      "---\n",
      "The 1900s saw a dramatic shift in the role of women in the workforce. Prior to this time, women were primarily homemakers and caregivers, with limited opportunities for paid work outside the home. However, with the rise of industrialization and the growth of the economy, women began to enter the workforce in increasing numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the primary factors that led to this change was the need for workers in factories and other industries. As men went off to war or pursued other opportunities, women were needed to fill the gaps in the workforce. This need for workers created a new sense of opportunity for women, who had previously been limited by social and cultural expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor that contributed to the change was the growing feminist movement. Women's rights activists worked to break down barriers and stereotypes that prevented women from pursuing their own goals and ambitions. They fought for equal pay, equal opportunities, and the right to vote, among other rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of these and other factors, women began to enter the workforce in increasing numbers. They worked in factories, offices, and other industries, often performing the same jobs as men. This shift in the role of women had a profound impact on society, changing the way that people thought about gender roles and the value of women's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, women continue to make up a significant portion of the workforce, and many have achieved success in a wide range of industries. While there is still work to be done to achieve true gender equality, the changes that began in the early 1900s have paved the way for a more diverse and inclusive workforce.\n"
